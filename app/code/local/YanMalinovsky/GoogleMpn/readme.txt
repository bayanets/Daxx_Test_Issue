HP/Magento Developer - Technical Task

Create a new module that will display the Google mpn number of a product underneath the product name on a standard
Magento (1.9 or higher) installation.

This should be a local installation if possible with demo data. You can use any namespace you like as long as it’s
unique and as with all modules, no core files should be altered.

The module should:

Create an attribute called – “google_mpn” which must be editable at a store view level in the backend
Display the google_mpn attribute value underneath the product title and should be red and bold and size 14px
Be self contained so it can be installed on a fresh installation of Magento and used out of the box
Not need to edit any core files, although if you need to extend core files that is acceptable
Be zipped up and sent across with any relevant documentation that may be needed for installation
(Only files you have modified/changed need to be sent across please do not include the entire Magento installation)
